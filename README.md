# codenames-game-ai

In this project, we attempt to create several methods for an AI to simulate playing the popular board game Codenames in Python.

## Retrieve Data

Due to their size, the processed datasets used in the game are stored separately in a public google drive. Here is the link to download them.

 `TODO` **Ideally we would give the user something to do this for them, like a .py**

Please save the folder outside this repository but in the same folder. Rename the folder with the processed as "AI_dataset"

## Environment Setup

### Local

* If you wish to run the game on a local Python environment, clone this repository into a storage folder of your choice and follow the directions for retrieving the data above.

* The Codenames code uses several python packages for data processing and display. They are:
  - nltk
  - termcolor

* Use `pip install` or `conda install` to install these packages in your local Python environment, depending on which your environment uses.

### Docker

**TODO: DOCKER SETUP Instructions`**

## Instructions

### Running the game

* Once the data has been retrieved and packages downloaded, simply run 'python run.py' and choose if you wish to watch an AIvsAI game or choose the game's parameters for yourself.

* Follow the instructions to generate your own Codenames game.

### Data collection **?Maybe we want to do this?**
